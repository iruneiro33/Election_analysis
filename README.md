# Election_analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The audit process is an important exercise to examine in close detail the results of the election. With the data provided we were able to assess who 
is the winner of the election in total votes and percentage. For this exercise we use Python and the Visual Studio console. 
In this challenge we have the table of results named election_results.txt. 

## Election Results 
From the code analysis, we can determine that the:
* Total votes in the election: 369,711
* Total votes in each county:
  ** Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  ** Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  ** Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
* County with the most amount of votes: Denver

* Total votes for each candidate:
    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

* The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, with 73.8% of the total votes (272,892).

## Future recommendations to use this code

This code is ready to be used if the data follows the same format. This is essential as the code will work with the total number of votes by county.
If there is a different format of the data, the code should be modified accordingly. The code also includes a simple way to show the output of the analysis into a easy-to-read chart saved in a .txt file. This is important as the people working in the election audit can have an output easy to understand by everyone, without even worrying about the code. Nonetheless, the part of the code that commands this is as follows:
